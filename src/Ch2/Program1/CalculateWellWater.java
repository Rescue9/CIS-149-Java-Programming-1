 * Program: CalculateWellWater.java
 * Class: CIS 149
 * Date: August 27, 2012
 * Programmer Andrew Buskov
 * Purpose: To calculate the amount of usable water in a well with given dimensions.
 * 
 * Many private water wells produce only 1 or 2 gallons of water per minute.
One way to avoid running out of water with these low-yield wells is to use a
holding tank. A family of 4 will use about 250 gallons of water per day. How-
ever, there is a “natural” water holding tank in the casing (i.e., the hole) of the
well itself. The deeper the well, the more water that will be stored that can be
pumped out for household use. But how much water will be available?

Write a program that allows the user to input the radius of the well
casing in inches (a typical well will have a 3-inch radius) and the depth
of the well in feet (assume water will fill this entire depth, although in
practice that will not be true since the static water level will generally be
50 feet or more below the ground surface). The program should output
the number of gallons stored in the well casing. For your reference:
The volume of a cylinder is PIr2h , where r is the radius and h is the height.
1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons of water.

For example, a 300-foot well full of water with a radius of 3 inches for the
casing holds about 441 gallons of water—plenty for a family of 4 and no
need to install a separate holding tank.
